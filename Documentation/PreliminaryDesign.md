# Guerrilla War Tactical
## Preliminary Design

This is an experimental overhaul of the game's tactical system, starting with
focus on XCOM's soldiers. Much of the abilities borne out of this overhaul
should be kicked on to an ADVENT overhaul down the track.

The overall concepts are as follows:
- remove all standard classes  (Sharpshooter, Grenadier, Ranger, Specialist)
- replace with a singular class, lets call it 'XCOM Operative'.
- remove weapon class restrictions, assume all soldiers have basic training in
  general usage of all weaponry.
- complement the removal of restrictions with more side effects, one of the
  easiest being mobility penalties based on weight.
- rebalance armour, health and damage types to encourage more variety in
  loadout choices and tactics in use.
- give 'staple' weapon specific abilities to the weapons themselves. Simple
  examples include giving Autocannons Suppression, and Assault Rifles
  light suppression.
- give the XCOM Operative's skill tree a broad set of veterancy perks which are
  not weapon specific. This would be a single class with perhaps 3 tracks,
  offensive, defensive, and stealth abilities.
- track weapon experience for units, allowing them to be trained in expertise
  of weapon categories for extra skills. (if this is hard to implement to begin
  with we can just add these skills to weapon abilities to test them out)


The goals of this design are:
- allow for more flexibility in loadout, with consequences for the choices made
- make the benefit from veterans less profound, so taking rookies out to fight
  isn't so risky
- make individual soldiers more unique when they're well developed
- make tactical choices more balanced in terms of viability, so a well
  balanced squad is encouraged via all choices supporting each other, rather
  than via random chance (the way XCOM gives your squad variety currently, GTS
  notwithstanding)
